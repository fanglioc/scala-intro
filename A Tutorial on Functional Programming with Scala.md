# A Tutorial on Functional Programming with Scala

# Intro

Functional programming is a paradigm that emphasizes on the use of pure functions and immutable data structures. Scala is one of the programming languages that supports functional programming concepts. In this tutorial, we will walk you through the basic concepts of functional programming using Scala.

## What is Functional Programming?

Functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data. It is based on lambda calculus which is a mathematical theory of functions.

## Why use Functional Programming?

Functional programming provides several benefits such as:

- It is easier to reason about code and debug.
- It enables parallelism and concurrency.
- It has a strong emphasis on immutability, which makes the code easier to test and maintain.
- It supports higher-order functions and function composition, which enables code reuse and modularity.

## Basic Concepts of Functional Programming in Scala

### Pure Functions

Pure functions are functions that do not have any side-effects and always return the same output for a given input. They are independent of the state of the program or the system. Pure functions are easy to test and reason about, and they are a key concept in functional programming. Here is an example of a pure function in Scala:

```
def add(x: Int, y: Int): Int = {
  x + y
}

```

### Immutable Data Structures

Immutable data structures are data structures that do not change once they are created. They are important in functional programming because they enable writing pure functions. In Scala, there are several immutable data structures such as List, Set, and Map. Here is an example of an immutable List in Scala:

```
val myList = List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

```

### Higher-Order Functions

Higher-order functions are functions that take one or more functions as arguments or return a function as a result. They are an important concept in functional programming because they enable function composition and code reuse. Here is an example of a higher-order function in Scala:

```
def applyFunction(f: Int => Int, x: Int): Int = {
  f(x)
}

```

### Function Composition

Function composition is the process of combining two or more functions to form a new function. It is an important concept in functional programming because it enables code reuse and modularity. Here is an example of function composition in Scala:

```
def addOne(x: Int): Int = {
  x + 1
}

def multiplyByTwo(x: Int): Int = {
  x * 2
}

val addOneAndMultiplyByTwo = addOne _ andThen multiplyByTwo

```
